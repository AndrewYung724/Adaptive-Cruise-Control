# Adaptive-Cruise-Control
Design of a game theoretic adaptive cruise control algorithm using a one player dynamic game model with full information structure. We apply a receding horizon control algorithm for predicting the actions of other players/drivers to yield the optimal acceleration.

## Model Assumptions

For this project we contrain the autonomous driving challenge to one-dimension where the autonomous driver is simply attempting to achieve its set speed while avoiding collisions.
